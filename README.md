### Database - MySQL
    1- Open Source and Cost-Effective: 
        MySQL is open-source software, which means it's free to use for most applications. 
        This can significantly reduce licensing costs compared to proprietary databases.

    2- ACID Compliance: 
        MySQL ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance for transactions, 
        which ensures data integrity and reliability.

    3- Performance: 
        MySQL is known for its speed and performance. 
        It can handle a large number of concurrent connections and transactions efficiently, which is crucial for scalable applications.

    4- Scalability: 
        MySQL can scale both vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) and 
        horizontally (by distributing data across multiple servers). This scalability makes it suitable for growing applications.
